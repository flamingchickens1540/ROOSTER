    A comment on the following two methods: Why are they synchronized? Why not use a more thread-safe data structure
	that better supports the intended use case? Because it doesn't really matter.

	In theory, it'd be nice to be able to say "Hey, this command isn't being used any more, let's ignore it when we're
	doing our calculations" while we're actually doing those calculations. But that actually isn't really a big deal.
	Any time we actually do need to register/unregister a command, it'll happen immediately after we're done managing
	the power for that cycle. Furthermore, if we allocate it power it doesn't use, that's not a huge problem for
	everyone else. There's also no good reason to access the map outside of the methods defined here, so just don't do
	it.
