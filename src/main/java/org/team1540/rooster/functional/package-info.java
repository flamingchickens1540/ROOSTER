/**
 * Extensions and additions to java's {@linkplain java.util.function functional interfaces}. The
 * extensions of common standard library functional interfaces contained in this package (namely
 * {@link org.team1540.rooster.functional.Input}, {@link org.team1540.rooster.functional.Processor},
 * and {@link org.team1540.rooster.functional.Output}) add some default methods to simplify chaining
 * (especially in the scenario of constructing a {@linkplain org.team1540.rooster.drive.pipeline
 * drive pipeline}). This package also contains the common {@link org.team1540.rooster.functional.Executable}
 * functional interface for a function that takes no arguments and returns no result.
